# Customer-Churn-Analysis-for-a-retail-company-using-SQL

**Project Overview**
Objective: Analyze customer behavior to identify factors contributing to customer churn and build a predictive model to flag at-risk customers.

**Business Goal**
Reduce customer churn rate by providing actionable insights to the marketing and customer service teams.

**Methodology**
The ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process was utilized as the methodology of choice to extrapolate pertinent information for this analysis. Azure Data Studio database was used to write queries to extract the required data and the results retrieved was saved in Excel to be transformed in Power BI. Data Tranformation in Power BI was used for
cleaning, filtering, aggregating and manipulating the data.
